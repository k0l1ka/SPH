# SPH

Simulation and visualization of fluids using smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.

- Fluid 3D simulation was made more realistic by adding the surface tension term as proposed in paper Muller, M., Charypar, D. and Gross, M., 2003, July. Particle-based fluid simulation for interactive applications.

- Calculations of smoothed fields are sped up at least by 2 times by using uniform grid acceleration.
